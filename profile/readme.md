## Welcome to libsese's homepage

At present, libsese focuses on developing a series of cross-platform components, 
and provides a convenient dependency import method combined with ~~CMake 3.14 FetchContent~~ feature.
Now change to using vcpkg.

P.S. It's more like a bunch of toys to me at the moment.
