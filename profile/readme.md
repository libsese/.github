### libsese Open Source

#### who we are?

We are developers for the libsese open source project. The project includes libraries and frameworks. The plan is to make fun toys, cool demos and anything that inspires you.

#### where is this?

This is the platform where we efficiently manage and house our code as well as our documentation, which is personal and largely open source with Apache 2.0 licenses.

#### any question?

- for the libraries or frameworks programing, try to read the [documents](https://libsese.github.io/sese.docs/#/).
- for anything else, you can prefer to contact us.
